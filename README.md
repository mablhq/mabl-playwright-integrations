This repository provides examples, tools, and utilities for integrating Mabl and Playwright.

## Project setup

- [Playwright 1.43.1 or greater](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#system-requirements)
- [Your mabl workspace ID](https://help.mabl.com/hc/articles/17782745983636)
- A [mabl API key](https://help.mabl.com/hc/articles/17776006239764) of type "Command Line Interface"
- [Credential ID](https://help.mabl.com/hc/articles/17782745983636) - create [mabl credentials](https://help.mabl.com/hc/articles/24758878555412) and get the ID
- [Database ID](https://help.mabl.com/hc/articles/17782745983636) - create a [database connection](https://help.mabl.com/hc/articles/27563281835284) and get the ID


> Note: This example project assumes that the database has a `pets` table.
